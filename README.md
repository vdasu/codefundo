While preditcting and foreseeing natural diseasters *is* important we believe it's imperarative not to overlook certain humanitarian aspects of the aftermath of the diseaster.   
We propose a solution to effetively and efficiently manage the logistcs involved in disseminating aid and relief to the ones trulty in need.   
The proposed method involves leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to ensure transparent and systematic dispersion of Resources and Aid to those who are truly in need. Our DAPP(Decentralized Application) acts as a liason between charitable benefators and citizens involved in the diseaster.
