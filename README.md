While predicting and foreseeing natural disasters *is* important, we believe it's imperative not to overlook certain humanitarian aspects of the aftermath of the diseaster.   
We propose a solution to effectively and efficiently manage the logistics involved in disseminating aid and relief to the ones truly in need.   
The proposed method involves leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to ensure transparent and systematic dispersion of Resources and Aid. Our DAPP(Decentralized Application) acts as a liason between charitable benefators and citizens involved in the diseaster.   
Relief not only includes monetary funds, but also items such as food, water and shelter. The blockchain would help volunteers and the governemnt who are responsible for distributing resources to target the most affected areas. Once resources have been distributed, the stock of resources would be updated. This would let the government and other donors know what kind of resources would be required and how much.   
An added advantage of using a blockchain for resource management is that transparency is assured, which in the case of providing relief is highly important. The transparency would legitimize the operation and encourage more people to support the cause.      
Finally, the blockchain provides valuable data at the end of disaster. This data could be analysed to further improve the operations and logistics in future disasters.
